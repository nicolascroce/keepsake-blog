Two updates this week in Keepsake.

## Companies

Until now, Keepsake managed your contacts — people. But in real life, your relationships aren't just with individuals. You interact with companies, organizations, schools, agencies.

You can now create **company profiles** in Keepsake. Each company has its own details (phone, email, address, website, notes), and you can link contacts to it.

In practice: you create a "Smith & Associates" profile, link Sarah (the accountant) and James (the partner) to it, and when you need the firm's number, everything is in one place.

Simple. Expected. Available now.

## Improved text editor

Keepsake's text editor has been completely redesigned. Smoother, more responsive, with better formatting support.

If you write longer notes — meeting summaries, reflections, project plans — you'll feel the difference.

Both improvements are already live. Open Keepsake and try them out.
